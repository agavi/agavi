		This is the base model all your application's models should extend.
		This way, you can easily inject new functionality into all of your models.
		
		It is of course highly recommended that you change the names of any default
		base classes to carry a prefix and have an overall meaningful naming scheme.
		You can enable the usage of the respective custom template files via
		build.properties settings. Also, keep in mind that you can define templates
		for specific modules in case you require this.
