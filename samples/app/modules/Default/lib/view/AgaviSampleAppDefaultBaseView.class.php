{
	/*
		This is the base view all your module's views should extend. This way,
		you can easily inject new functionality into all of this module's views.
		
		One example would be to extend a setupHtml() method and assign attributes
		that many templates in this module use.
		
		Even if you don't need any of the above and this class remains empty, it is
		strongly recommended you keep it. There shall come the day where you are
		happy to have it this way ;)
		
		It is of course highly recommended that you change the names of any default
		base classes to carry a prefix and have an overall meaningful naming scheme.
		You can enable the usage of the respective custom template files via
		build.properties settings. Also, keep in mind that you can define templates
		for specific modules in case you require this.
