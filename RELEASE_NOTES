AGAVI RELEASE NOTES
===================

Version 1.1.0 - August ??, 2009
===============================

Response
--------
Response classes now extend from AgaviAttributeHolder instead of AgaviParameterHolder. Attributes from each namespace are merged over individually, in the same way as HTTP headers, cookies and other metadata - info from the "child" response does not overwrite info on the response the data is merged to ("parent"). If however the attribute already exists in the parent, and both parent and child value are an array, then those values are merged. In this case, for identical keys, the value from the child array does not overwrite the value from the parent array. Numeric keys, however get appended. You can use this functionality to, for instance, implement caching of metadata such as CSS and JavaScript files to be loaded in the Master template - something that is not possible with global response attribute once you start using such functionality in slots - caching the response attributes would mean corrupt data with slots re-used on different pages.
